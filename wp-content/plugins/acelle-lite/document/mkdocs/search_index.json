The followings are required by Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest version of Wordpress up and running\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System: Linux (RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.). Unfortunately we have yet to support Windows or Mac OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP Version: 5.6, 7.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMySQL Version: >= 5.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication server: Apache 2.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the PHP extensions that are required for installing Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbstring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDO Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokenizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP Zip Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMAP Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry if you are not sure which extensions are available on your server, Acelle Lite will check and prompt you to install the missing ones (if any) during the installation wizard.\n\n\n2.2. Installation steps\n\n\nSuppose your Wordpress source is located at \n/user/www/wordpress\n, then the installation steps are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract the Acelle Mail zipped file, you will come up with an \nacelle-lite\n folder containing the source files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the \nacelle-lite\n folder to the plugins folder of your Wordpress instance so that you can come up with the following path: \n/user/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/acelle-lite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Wordpress using y our admin account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Plugins menu, you will see Acelle Mail plugin there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivate the plugin and you will see the Acelle Mail menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are all done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting up the plugin, just click on the menu item to setup and send your first campaign!\n\n\n3. Configuration wizard\n\n\nAt your first visit to the plugin, you need to go through the configuration wizard to setup your email settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Acelle Mail will check if there is any library missing on the server and will remind you to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the database connection is established, Acelle Mail will initialize the database with the default settings as well as create the default administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcelle Mail will generate the cronjob settings so that you can install to your system. Cronjobs are used to trigger the email campaigns as well as other system processes in the background. Remember that Acelle Mail source folder must be \nwritable\n by the cronjob processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after everything is setup. You are ready to go with Acelle Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Create your first campaign\n\n\nIn order to send an email campaigns, the followings are required:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sending server (an application, a SMTP server or a 3rd service) which actually delivers our emails\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mail list containing the subscribers to whom we're are sending emails to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1. Create a sending server\n\n\nYou must configure at least one sending server for the system. \nGo to menu \nSending\n > \nSending Servers\n, then choose a sending server type to create\n\n\nAs of version \n2.0.5\n, the following sending server types are supported by Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard SMTP\n: send email through an internal/external SMTP service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendmail\n: send email directly through the \nsendmail\n program on the hosting server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP mail() function\n: send email directly through the \nmail()\n function of PHP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon SES API/SMTP\n: send email through Amazon Simple Mail Service, using either Amazon's web API or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMailgun API/SMTP\n: send email through Mailgun, using either Mailgun's web API or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendGrid API/SMTP\n: send email through SendGrid, using either SendGrid's web API (v2) or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElasticEmail API\n: send email through ElasticEmail, using its web API (v2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore to be supported...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Then you can add subscribers to your list (or potential subscribers can subscribe to your list through Acelle Mail supscription form).
